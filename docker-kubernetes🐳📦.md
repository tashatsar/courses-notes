## Introduction

A **container** is a unit of software that encapsulates everything needed to build, ship, and run applications.

Why containersüì¶:
- lower deployment time and costs
- better utilization
- automate processes
- microservices support
- operating system, programming language, and platform-independent

Major container vendors:
- Docker is a robust platform and the most popular container platform, flexible scaling and portability
- Podman is a daemon-less container engine that is more secure than Docker
- LXC for data-intensive applications and operations
- Vagrant for the highest levels of isolation on the running physical machine

### Docker üì¶üö¢

Docker: open platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications as containers. Docker containers are **not a good fit** for applications based on monolithic architecture or applications that require high performance or security. 

**Docker architecture**: 
- client (docker build, docker push, docker run)
- host (Dockerfiles, images (copies), containers, networks, storage volumes, and other objects, such as plugins and add-ons)
- container registry (image)

Docker uses networks to isolate container communications. Docker uses volumes and binds mounts to persist data even after a container stops running. Docker container is runnable instance of an image.

Steps used to create and run containers:
1. create a Dockerfile
2. use it to create a container image
3. use the container image to create a running container

## Cheat Sheet: Docker CLI
| Command	| Description |
|-|-|
`curl localhost`	| Pings the application
`docker build` |	Builds an image from a Dockerfile
`docker build . -t` |	Builds the image and tags the image id
`docker CLI` |	Start the Docker command line interface.
`docker container rm` |	Removes a container
`docker images` |	Lists the images
`docker ps` |	Lists the containers
`docker ps -a` |	Lists the containers that ran and exited successfully
`docker pull` |	Pulls the latest image or repository from a registry
`docker push` |	Pushes an image or a repository to a registry
`docker run` |	Runs a command in a new container
`docker run -p` |	Runs the container by publishing the ports
`docker stop` |	Stops one or more running containers
`docker stop $(docker ps -q)` |	Stops all running containers
`docker tag` |	Creates a tag for a target image that refers to a source image
`docker --version` |	Displays the version of the Docker CLI
`exit` |	Closes the terminal session
`export MY_NAMESPACE` |	Exports a namespace as an environment variable
`git clone` |	Clones the git repository that contains the artifacts needed
`ibmcloud cr` | images	Lists images in the IBM Cloud Container Registry
`ibmcloud cr login` |	Logs your local Docker daemon into IBM Cloud Container Registry
`ibmcloud cr namespaces` |	Views the namespaces you have access to
`ibmcloud cr region-set` |	Ensures that you are targeting the region appropriate to your cloud account
`ibmcloud target` |	Provides information about the account you‚Äôre targeting
`ibmcloud version` |	Displays the version of the IBM Cloud CLI


Glossary: Container Basics
Term	Definition
- container: a standard unit of software that encapsulates the application code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings necessary for programmers to efficiently build, ship and run applications
- Container Registry:	Used for the storage and distribution of named container images. While many features can be built on top of a registry, its most basic functions are to store images and retrieve them.
- Daemon-less: container runtime that does not run any specific program (daemon) to create objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- Dockerfile: a text document that contains all the commands you would normally execute manually in order to build a Docker image. Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.
- Docker client: the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.
- Docker daemon (dockerd):	creates and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- Docker plugins	such as a storage plugin, provides the ability to connect external storage platforms.
- Docker storage	uses volumes and bind mounts to persist data even after a running container is stopped.
- Registry: a hosted service containing repositories of images which responds to the Registry API
- Repository:	a set of Docker images. A repository can be shared by pushing it to a registry server. The different images in the repository can be labelled using tags.
- Tag:	a label applied to a Docker image in a repository. Tags are how various images in a repository are distinguished from each other.
