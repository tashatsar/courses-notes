## Intro to testing🍏 

Why to do testing:
- verification that the software works as expected
- preventing future code breaks and compatibility issues
- reducing overall development time

The software **testing process includes four levels**: 
1) unit: testing individual units or components of a software system
2) integration: combine individual units and test them as a group
3) system: test a complete, integrated system
4) acceptance: the system is tested for acceptability by the end user

Test cases **drive code design** in both behavior driven development (BDD) and test driven development (TDD). 

BDD: focuses on the system from the outside in, used for for integration and acceptance testing 

TDD: focuses on the system from the inside out. used for for unit testing
