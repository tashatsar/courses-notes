## Intro to testing🍏 

Why to do testing:
- verification that the software works as expected
- preventing future code breaks and compatibility issues
- reducing overall development time

The software **testing process includes four levels**: 
1) unit: testing individual units or components of a software system
2) integration: combine individual units and test them as a group
3) system: test a complete, integrated system
4) acceptance: the system is tested for acceptability by the end user

Test cases **drive code design** in both behavior driven development (BDD) and test driven development (TDD). 

BDD: focuses on the system from the outside in, used for for integration and acceptance testing 

TDD: focuses on the system from the inside out, used for for unit testing

## Test driven development🚨✅🔨

In TDD, test cases drive code design. The Red🚨/Green✅/Refactor🔨 workflow.
TDD saves development time and ensures that the code works as expected. 

To create a DevOps pipeline, you must automate all testing. 

### Frameworks:
- The **xUnit series** is one of the most popular testing frameworks for TDD, while others include Jasmine for JavaScript, Mocha for Node.js, and SimpleTest for PHP
- The two most popular testing frameworks for Python are **PyUnit and Pytest**. Two other popular testing frameworks for Python are Doctest and RSpec
- **Nose** is a Python test runner that can add color to test output and call the code coverage tool
