# [Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hands-on-introduction-to-linux-commands-and-shell-scripting) by Coursera
üëçPro: Hands-on Labs and examples of code are great, explanations are clear, cheet-sheets are extremely useful.

üëéCons: Practice and final project were quite disappointing for me. Tasks description was confusing and even incorrect by moments, and the solution provided was not optimal. The final project will not work if done as described in the assignment.

‚åöDuration: 14 hours

## Linuxüêß
### Introduction to Linuxüëã
|Linux|Information|
|---|---|
|**usage**|mobile devices, desktops, supercomputers, data centers, and cloud servers|
|**distros**|distributions differ by UIs, shell applications, and how the OS is supported and built. Popular distros: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, Ubuntu, Suse (SLES, SLED, OpenSuse), Fedora, Mint, and Arch.|
|**layers**|five key layers: the UI, application, OS, kernel, and hardware|
|**user interface**|enables users to interact with applications|
|**application**|enable users to perform tasks within the system|
|**OS**|runs on top of the kernel and is vital for system health and stability|
|**kernel**|the lowest-level software that enables applications to interact with hardware|
|**hardware**|includes all the physical or electronic components of your PC|
|**shell**|OS-level application to send commands via terminal|
|**filesystem**|tree-like structure consisting of all directories and files on the system|
|**text editors**|command-line or GUI-based text editors such as GNU nano, vim, vi, and gedit|
|**package managers**|DEB and RPM packages are used by package managers in Linux operating systems. They are distinct file types containing software or updates for different Linux operating systems.|
|**.deb file**s|used for Debian-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint. Deb stands for Debian.|
|**.rpm files**|used for Red Hat-based distributions such as CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, and openSUSE. RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager.|
|**convert packages**|Deb and RPM formats are equivalent, the contents of the file can be used on other types of Linux OSs. TO convert use the `alien` command and specify the package name that you want to convert|

## Shell Scriptingüêö
### Introduction to Shellüëã
A script is a list of commands that can be interpreted and run by a scripting language. Scripting languages are usually not compiled and are interpreted at runtime. Scripts are widely used to automate processes and perform system administration tasks.
Shell scripts are executable text files that begin with a 'shebang' (#!) interpreter directive. Shell scripts can be used to execute commands and run other programs.

Compiled languages may be faster than scripting languages but require more development time.

#### Basic Commands
- `ls -l filename.sh` check permissions
- `chmod u+x filename.sh ` give permission to the current user
- `chmod +x filename.sh ` give permission to all users

#### Shell file example
```
echo -n "firstname:"
read firstname
echo -n "lastname:"
read lastname
echo "Hello $firstname $lastname "
```

#### Bash Shell Features
**Metacharacters** are characters having special meaning that the shell interprets as instructions:
- `#` Precedes a comment
- `;` Command separator
- `*` Filename expansion wildcard (`ls *.txt`)
- `?` Single character wildcard in filename expansion (`ls file?.txt`)

**Double quotes** `" "`: most characters are interpreted literally, but metacharacters are interpreted according to their special meaning

**Single quotes** `' '`: all characters and metacharacters enclosed within the quotes are interpreted literally. 

For example: `$ echo "Hello $USER"` vs `$ echo 'Hello $USER'` (gives `Hello <username>` and `Hello $USER` accordingly)


**Input/Output redirection**
|Symbol	|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**>**	|Redirect output to file, overwrite|
|**>>**	|Redirect output to file, append|
|**2>**	|Redirect standard error to file, overwrite|
|**2>>**	|Redirect standard error to file, append|
|**<**	|Redirect file contents to standard input|

Input/output (IO) redirection is the process of directing the flow of data between a program and its input/output sources.

By default, a program reads input from standard input, the keyboard, and writes output to standard output, the terminal. However, using IO redirection, you can redirect a program's input or output to or from a file or another program.

**Command Line Arguments**
Command line arguments are additional inputs that can be passed to a program when the program is run from a command line interface. These arguments are specified after the name of the program, and they can be used to modify the behavior of the program, provide input data, or provide output locations. Command line arguments are used to pass arguments to a shell script.

For example, the following command provides two arguments, arg1, and arg2, that can be accessed from within your Bash script:
```
$ ./MyBashScript.sh arg1 arg2
```
